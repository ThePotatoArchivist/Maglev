Copper magnetic levitation minecart rails!

Maglev adds several sets of copper rails which allow minecarts to hover in the air.

This mod was based on [this r/minecraftsuggestions reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/tepegh/levitation_rails_an_upgrade_to_minecart_systems/) by u/Creative-Kreature.

## Additions

### Maglev Rails

- Allows a minecart to hover up to 15 blocks above the rail
    - The minecart can be made to hover by dropping it from the end of normal rails
- Comes in all waxed and oxidized copper variants

### Powered Maglev Rails

- Allows minecarts to hover just like maglev rails
- Accelerates the minecart just like powered rails
- Comes in all waxed and oxidized copper variants

## Mechanics

- While hovering, minecarts have no friction and have no sound
- Minecarts have different max speeds on different oxidized rails:
  | Oxidation | Max Speed |
  | --- | --- |
  | Unoxidized | 12 blocks/tick |
  | Exposed | 8 blocks/tick |
  | Weathered | 4 blocks/tick |
  | Oxidized | 1 blocks/tick |
- Minecarts remember which track they're on so rails can cross underneath and they stay on the right track
- You may place blocks between the rail and minecart to have invisible rails
